                <h2> Early Life </h2> 
            
                    <p> Sylvia Earle is an American oceanographer and explorer known for her research on marine algae and her books and documentaries designed to raise awareness of the threats that overfishing and pollution pose to the world’s oceans. Earle also held the world record for the deepest untethered dive. Earle was the second of three children born to electrical engineer Lewis Reade Earle and his wife, Alice Freas Richie. She spent her early life on a small farm near Camden, New Jersey.  When she was 12, her father moved the family to Dunedin, Florida, where the family’s waterfront property afforded Earle the opportunity to investigate living things inhabiting nearby salt marshes and sea grass beds. </p>
                  
                <h2> Education </h2> 
                    <p> Earle first learned to dive with SCUBA gear while attending Florida State University. She majored in botany and graduated in 1955. Later that year she enrolled in the master’s program in botany at Duke University, graduating in 1956. She completed her thesis work on algae in the Gulf of Mexico. Earle married American zoologist John Taylor in 1957 and started a family. (She and Taylor later divorced.) She completed a Ph.D. in 1966, publishing her dissertation Phaeophyta of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico in 1969. For this project she collected over 20,000 samples of algae. </p>
            
                <h2> Success </h2> 
                    <p> Earle’s postgraduate experiences were a mixture of research and groundbreaking oceanographic exploration. In 1965 she accepted a position as the resident director of <!-- This is a website that leads to more information about Cape Haze Marine Laboratories. --> <a href="https://mote.org/about-us/history"> Cape Haze Marine Laboratories</a> in Sarasota, Florida. In 1967 she became a research fellow at the Farlow Herbarium of Harvard University and a research scholar at the Radcliffe Institute. In 1968 she discovered undersea dunes off the coast of the Bahamas. In 1970 she led the first all-female team of women aquanauts as part of the <!-- This is a website that leads to more information about the Tektite II. --> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tektite-II"> Tektite II experiment</a>, a project designed to explore the marine realm and test the viability of deepwater habitats and the health effects of prolonged living in underwater structures. The habitat was located about 15 metres (about 50 feet) below the surface of Great Lameshur Bay off the island of St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. During the two-week experiment, she observed the effects of pollution on coral reefs first hand. Occurring during a time when American women were just beginning to enter fields traditionally staffed by men, the Tektite II project captured the imagination of scientists and nonscientists alike because Earle’s team did the same work as previous all-male crews. </p>
